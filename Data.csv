You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it

I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds

I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark

I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true

(Oh, oh) oh, no, oh no (oh)
Hey, yeah, diri-diri-diriridi, Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino, que yo voy (oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos, despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam

Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo, aquí tengo la pieza, oye

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto

Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than what its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die, they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne's world

Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Nobody knows what to do, we're all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There's aliens, I'm telling you there's aliens

Don't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship)
(My planet's outside there waiting)
(I can't stay in your backpack forever, stay in your backpack)

On our planet, we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

I just wanna know the issue

Yea
I got shit on my mind

First off, this song, missedly took it wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you out making out with my dawg
Went to school together
Took the bus and all, back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it's head off
Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same
Looked down the shit I saw now, I don't look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that's embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we're related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hated
I know you think 'cause this fame I'm probably jaded
Ain't get a chance to see yo daughter, tell er have it but lady
For me, I don't care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that's all me, being smart don't mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in the driver's seat
Take your shades off, I'm like
(Remember me?)

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory
Judging my highlights when it's shots like Ory
Always tryin to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cause you really can't relate to me
Your remarks, playin league out of character
Your social past couldn't make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cause I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You're a fan nigga? It's cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don't need that
You like it? Buy it,
You don't? don't cop it
Catid, it be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can't blame yo ignorance
It's irrelevant, I'm relevant
I'm big event so go ahead and vent
I'm big event so go ahead and vent

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song

Birds ring, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie's nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don't want it to speak
Don't mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats
Tryna compete, T-Raww's
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is there to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It's rules to the shit, but just it ain't a game
Give or take, niggas still gon violate
Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin
You tough? It's always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law
Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybachs, how hood is that?
Blacks on the wall, wall, my stick on gap
Backpack backpack backpack, rap whenever was that

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will

And, baby, my heart
Could still fall as hard at 23

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm
I know you will still love me the same

Could never grow old, it's evergreen

And, baby, your smile's
Forever in my mind and memory

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever

Knows everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well

A-a-a-a-a-a-a, amen, amen, amen

I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human
Only then, I am clean

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know

And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And is the only thing
That I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die, mmm

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

And I wanted it, and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags

Yeah, let's be clear I'll trust no one

You did not break me

I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart

'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate

And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm p-, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
""Next time? There won't be no next time""
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to f- leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing

The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing

Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me

So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-
Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho-ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes
(What you see? What you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shining lights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Ben's completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth
He's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack
Blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer
But they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Llike my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug, huh, your drug
Huh, your drug is my love, your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry

She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature 'cause to me, she zero degrees
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas, now she's my Miss America
Now, can I be her soldier please?
I'm fighting for this girl on the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby Cupid sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy

Baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is fallin' down
You'll be my only, no need to worry

"145","You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said
""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Uh, used to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love
But you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care, but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we're both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club
I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, whatchu trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go

So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick
She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

Caution when it comes to love

You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts

Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness

Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa

Fuck no! Go for broke

He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes

That I'm talkin' about when we riot

To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit

But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen

But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it

Ayo Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When your doing that thing over there homie

Let's go!
'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day, go!
See they don't really wanna pop me
Just know that you never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow

And then I gotta shudder any little thing that nigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A nigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And niggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this

And I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go
See the way we on and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
We struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And always gotta take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through his traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it, have it

What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' fuck 'em five

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh

See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
