You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it

I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds

I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark

I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true

(Oh, oh) oh, no, oh no (oh)
Hey, yeah, diri-diri-diriridi, Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino, que yo voy (oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos, despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam

Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo, aquí tengo la pieza, oye

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto

Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than what its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die, they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne's world

Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Nobody knows what to do, we're all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There's aliens, I'm telling you there's aliens

Don't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship)
(My planet's outside there waiting)
(I can't stay in your backpack forever, stay in your backpack)

On our planet, we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

I just wanna know the issue

Yea
I got shit on my mind

First off, this song, missedly took it wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you out making out with my dawg
Went to school together
Took the bus and all, back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it's head off
Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same
Looked down the shit I saw now, I don't look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that's embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we're related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hated
I know you think 'cause this fame I'm probably jaded
Ain't get a chance to see yo daughter, tell er have it but lady
For me, I don't care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that's all me, being smart don't mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in the driver's seat
Take your shades off, I'm like
(Remember me?)

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory
Judging my highlights when it's shots like Ory
Always tryin to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cause you really can't relate to me
Your remarks, playin league out of character
Your social past couldn't make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cause I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You're a fan nigga? It's cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don't need that
You like it? Buy it,
You don't? don't cop it
Catid, it be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can't blame yo ignorance
It's irrelevant, I'm relevant
I'm big event so go ahead and vent
I'm big event so go ahead and vent

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song

Birds ring, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie's nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don't want it to speak
Don't mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats
Tryna compete, T-Raww's
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is there to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It's rules to the shit, but just it ain't a game
Give or take, niggas still gon violate
Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin
You tough? It's always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law
Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybachs, how hood is that?
Blacks on the wall, wall, my stick on gap
Backpack backpack backpack, rap whenever was that

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will

And, baby, my heart
Could still fall as hard at 23

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm
I know you will still love me the same

Could never grow old, it's evergreen

And, baby, your smile's
Forever in my mind and memory

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever

Knows everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well

A-a-a-a-a-a-a, amen, amen, amen

I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human
Only then, I am clean

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know

And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And is the only thing
That I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die, mmm

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans

Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

And I wanted it, and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags

Yeah, let's be clear I'll trust no one

You did not break me

I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart

'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate

And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm p-, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
""Next time? There won't be no next time""
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to f- leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing

The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing

Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me

So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-
Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho-ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes
(What you see? What you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shining lights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Ben's completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth
He's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack
Blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer
But they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Llike my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug, huh, your drug
Huh, your drug is my love, your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry

She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature 'cause to me, she zero degrees
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas, now she's my Miss America
Now, can I be her soldier please?
I'm fighting for this girl on the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby Cupid sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy

Baby, don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is fallin' down
You'll be my only, no need to worry

"145","You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said
""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Uh, used to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love
But you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care, but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we're both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club
I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, whatchu trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go

So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick
She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

Caution when it comes to love

You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts

Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness

Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa

Fuck no! Go for broke

He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes

That I'm talkin' about when we riot

To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit

But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Like you never had a love, had a love

Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'

That you deserve the best, you're beautiful

To brush the dangerous

To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory

Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself

But I thought I knew everything I never felt

Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side

Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong

Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside

I know this dude's balling but yeah that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl

Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head

"217","I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge, and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore

Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and when shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on bulbs
Hit one switch mayne, that ass so low
Cali' got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me

You know I'm rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (Ahh!)

Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt and ya done
Homie, it's Game time, you ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months but Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a gun, ready? Here it come
Gotta sick, vendetta to get this, cheddar

Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope for a four finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride and if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide

Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense

Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing?
And I know what I'm going through

In my head there's only you now
And this world falls on me
And in this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

And you love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go
Let me go

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
But all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go

You love me but you don't
You love me but you don't
You love me, but you don't know who I am

You love me but you don't
You love me but you don't
You love me, but you don't know me

Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today, and

Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Oh I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
On holiday!

Hey!

Three, four!

The representative from California has the floor
""Sieg Heil"" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government

""Bang! Bang!"" goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Try to fight fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me

Just 'cause (hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah (hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Ya know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she couldn't take it no more and decided to leave

Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin for her

Backtracking on these few years
Tryin'a figure out what I do to make it go bad

Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see

So happy but now so lonely...

Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beatin' and tearin' down your walls

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eying you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could

But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on, on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, 'cause tonight we cutting, gut busting

I'm digging in your walls something vicious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut something serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses

And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I'll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom

Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you 'til you run out of breathe
Then bust a nut all over yourself

The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall

I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

From the back then to the side to the front
Turn around, you down to ride
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey and that's fo' sho'

I like the way your hands rub against my balls
'Cause you the one, a nigga met at South Dekalb Mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all

135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, you a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you

Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

What it is hoe, ah what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call

Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me I can find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is, incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

Now you trying to lock me in the room, trying to turn me on

Tryin' to keep my eyes closed
Tryin' to keep it just like before

Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past

Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody else
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is) when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad

Then he said goodbye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

(Truth is) and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is) when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
Because I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing
With my mind, because I know

You and me are still good friends

Caught him with a jab
Caught him with an uppercut
Kicked him in his ass
Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk
Ain't no trips to the county, I ain't for that walk

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave,
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby youuuu and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)

She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams but I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, she's the one I'm after

She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for

She runs on one hundred proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her

And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else

She won't pick up the phone, she'd rather be alone

Still ringin' in my head

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony, in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh-oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'

Now you gushin' ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist down, now your wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day

Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit, dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually, niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to your projects

No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
Could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then, didn't even get mad
Now think about, ""Damn, what a life I had!""

Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more

Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me

No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

I turn my head to the East, I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West, still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North, swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright

I turn my head to the East, I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West, still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North, swallow that pill that they call pride

"292","I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking His last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I want to be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

Early morning
The city breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?

Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky
Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could
Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em
Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now

This a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty

Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

They didn't even make up (a sound)

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
(Standing in the light of your halo)
(I got my angel now)

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
All right everybody, I need you right now
Put your hands together and sing with me
C'mon

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo

That was the night I saw my hero perform for the very first time
That was the night I experienced the magic of Michael Jackson
Everyone, I want you to put your lighters in the air
Put your glowsticks in the air, put your cellphones in the air
And help us celebrate Michael's life

'Cause everywhere we're looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Michael, we can feel your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Michael, we can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away, no, no

Pray it won't fade away, pray it won't fade away
Pray it won't fade away, pray it won't fade away
Pray it won't fade away, no, pray it won't fade away, no
Pray it won't fade away, pray it won't fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away

Oh, I can breathe it
I can see your

It's just the medicine little bit of weed mix with the good liquor trigers my adrenaline
Little bit of weed never kill no one mr law so don't be mad at me, me, me
Legel or not that shit don't matter me, me, me

Day and night
I find myself thanking god for my left
Because I took all the wrong and made it right
And I picked rapping over dealing white, white, white
I took my fathers hustle, And I took all of my families struggle

Mixed it up with all my mothers pain, But wot you see is wot gives pitbull's a name, name, name

Because day and night
I find myself alone in this fame

They know my music but not my mind
They can try but they won't stop my hustle grind, grind, grind

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind,
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play
Now look at this

Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last last

Because day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change (never change)

So I get high just like I'm born to fly
I'm in the court wif marijuana eyes
We hit the clubs until the morning rise
Cause day and night
We run the streets
Hope I dnt pay dat prise
Dey qot d nerve to tell me press my brakes
And If I do how will rent qet paid paid
So now I'm thinkin dat
2OO stacks wat wuld it bring me back
Espically now dat reseccions hit

My only answer to my question is is
Okay now here is a thought
Streets is a marriage that u can divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love

So I treat the game just like I'm selling drugs, drugs

Then I answer give em cancer
And they come back for me
So why they mad at me
Cause my mental compacity
Get to over lapping them bastards
The audasity haters even clap 4 me
Realizing actually I represent the betterment
And they just late like letterman, man

Contact my d a zon

Sicker than I eva been
They won't me instead of em
And if they dislike it

Guess I'm spose to let em win
If u was to bet again
It be best if you would just
Put paper on the medicine
I'll let u know
I walk all thrrough ya vestibule

Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive

Make you come alive

And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Baby like socks that's on the ground

Is neither of us is listening

(Feat. Drake)

Since BIG ain't here, I'mma do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave for Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, gettin' beat on by their man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missin' women out there, let's just focus on them

This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm about to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way
When police came our way, my daddy had his act on
Like it never happened: (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga, she ain't gotta deal wit' ya
You want some money? Nigga I ain't get a deal wit' ya
You ain't sayin' nothin', you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air cause
You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve McNair

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I, wont)
If you don't, you gon' really love us (I said I wont)
Please don't use us, dooon't

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models, but hmm... I don't believe 'em
Who's still gettin' tested?
Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be your King, be a Queen Latifah
I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa
I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of
You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly
A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly
Her hearts a lil' chilly, she a little too carefree
In 10 years, who's paying for all that therapy
Umm, nigga not me!
Yeah, I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I'm done with bad bitches I'm coming straight to you
Good girl

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon' really love us
Please don't use us, dooon't

Drizzy, I'm sittin here watchin' Basketball Wives
Like ugh, them is basketball wives?
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first day
Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday
And tell her ass, get on
That type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy world""
""Get busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girl""
She walking round the club all lost like ""where is he, girl?""
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray
That's your girl, nigga go on make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche, like ""Lets ride""

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon' really love us
Please don't use us, dooon't

Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And that's my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin

In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre)
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

(And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!)
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm

Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'

Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move"", a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine

But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

Next the walls were closed on me
I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Roman Calvary choirs are singing

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
The shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

And what are all your names, again? We drunk, remind us

Are any of y'all into girls like I am? Let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful

I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, ""Pussy, pussy, pussy""
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her

She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider, man

'Cause we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh

Oh-oh-oh

I ain't being disrespectful, baby, I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world

Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all

I'm scrollin' down my call log, and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out ""papi"" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on

And Hillary can Rodham too, boy, I gets my pimpin' on

'Cause we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh

For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about three years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no, not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior 'cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
'Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

We're havin' us some beers and
Swappin' ""I don't cares""
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the Hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

He said I fought two wars
Been married and divorced
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, ""These damn things will kill me yet""

But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call it's 2:00 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face

He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as Hell
Huh, but me, I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave

That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, no air air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew right off
The ground and float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down, for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, no air air
No air air, no air air (no more)

There's no no air?

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, no air air

Got me here out in the water so deep
Tell me how you goin' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe

And you tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that

Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this
If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Today

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
My heavy heart sinks deep down under

You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this, too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it

You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this
Is that why you wanted a love song

'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
Or you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason to write you a love song today

Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl

In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again, play it again

Then she hit the floor, now

With a see-through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a nigga know if I take her home, with them wide-ass hips
You're damn right, I'm gon' beep

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big-ass booty with a little-bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit""

See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one

And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are grown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performin' for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

If you are
What you say you are
Then have no fear

Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island, into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time

And felt the fire in your sweet embrace, (I swear I knew) I swear

Let's take this now before it's gone like yesterday, no
'Cause when I'm with you, there's nowhere else that I would ever wanna be, no
I'm breathin' for the next second I can feel you lovin' me

Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me

She chose to stay at home
So they could be a family
For the children but what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired

With no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's, mad at me

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies

But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees

Who you think brought you the oldies

Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, â€½Motherfuck the policeâ€
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good

Who's the doc that he told you to go see

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study your tape of NWA

One day I was walkin' by with a Walkman on
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
(What you lookin' at?)
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck, right next
To a humongous truck in a two car garage

Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through

Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out

From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew

Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies in a Mercedes Benz
With the windows up and the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy, there is no way
That you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailey

Like you want somethin' free

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of

Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all

'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail
All day sayin' Dre fell off, what 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad, tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath

It ain't gonna be nothin' after that, so give me one more
Platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle

'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone, I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're dogging me

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When I try to get your attention
You ignore me everytime
You were so caught up doing your dirt
That you didn't notice mine

Well, I couldn't put up with your scheming
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs won't make it right
But it's suiting me just fine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop (don't think I'm not)

When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

Don't be surprised to know that sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it but it's real
The game is so real, so real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it, when you're out in the club

But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

(Go for the moon, go, go)
(Go for the moon, go, go)
(Go for the moon)
(Go, go, go for the moon)

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked
""Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place""
I said, ""Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself""
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

"496","Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh a beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel

May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time

It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness

Oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

"497","At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your cheque next week

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card (card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'

And then you use my cellphone (phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh, yeah)
Well, we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire, and it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire, to take me away (oh, it's true)
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darlin', please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

I wish that I, that I could stay
But girl, you know I got to go, oh

"499","Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream, that I heard last

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
And now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

"500","I was always okay
But I watched friends grow up poor
Not sure where their next meal would be
Latchkey and and lonely at heart

Every single breath I take is reassurance
I try not to take my life for granted
It all just flashes by so fast
Try to savour our time before it's gone

What I wouldn't give to be standing next to you
A lifetime of struggle just to get where I am
Persistence, resilience, and a heart full of flair
I've made this far and I'm not stopping here

All these old songs take me back
Summer nights with my best friends
Walking through a town that never
Cut us any slack

I've always had this scary feeling
That everything good in my life
Will be gone by the time I wake up
I've had it too good for too long

What I wouldn't give to be standing next to you
A lifetime of struggle just to get where I am
Persistence, resilience, and a heart full of flair
I've made this far and I'm not stopping here

The things I thought I needed
Were just holding me back
I'm doing fine without you
I'm growing without your chains
I never thought I'd live
To see the day where
I'd finally get to
Be on my own

The things I thought I needed
