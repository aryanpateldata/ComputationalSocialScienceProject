"Run that back, Turbo!

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancing in the dial, like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GunWun not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches getting saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lacking, why I'm working on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names (uh)

Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar

Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true

Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off with someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that

Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Oh, I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (oh, I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

(Oh, oh) oh, no, oh no (oh)
Hey, yeah, diri-diri-diriridi, Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino, que yo voy (oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos, despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam

Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo, aquí tengo la pieza, oye

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido (DY)

"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than what its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til my lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old

First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Nobody knows what to do, we're all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There's aliens, I'm telling you there's aliens

Don't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship)
(My planet's outside there waiting)
(I can't stay in your backpack forever, stay in your backpack)

On our planet, we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

"I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue

Yea
I got shit on my mind

First off, this song, missedly took it wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you out making out with my dawg
Went to school together
Took the bus and all, back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it's head off
Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same
Looked down the shit I saw now, I don't look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that's embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we're related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hated
I know you think 'cause this fame I'm probably jaded
Ain't get a chance to see yo daughter, tell er have it but lady
For me, I don't care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that's all me, being smart don't mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in the driver's seat
Take your shades off, I'm like
(Remember me?)

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory
Judging my highlights when it's shots like Ory
Always tryin to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cause you really can't relate to me
Your remarks, playin league out of character
Your social past couldn't make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cause I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You're a fan nigga? It's cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don't need that
You like it? Buy it,
You don't? don't cop it
Catid, it be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can't blame yo ignorance
It's irrelevant, I'm relevant
I'm big event so go ahead and vent
I'm big event so go ahead and vent

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue

Listen to this song
Listen to this song

If you know what you say then say who you are

Tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
Make a diss song
Tell em play this song

Birds ring, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie's nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don't want it to speak
Don't mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats
Tryna compete, T-Raww's
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is there to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It's rules to the shit, but just it ain't a game
Give or take, niggas still gon violate
Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin
You tough? It's always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law
Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybachs, how hood is that?
Blacks on the wall, wall, my stick on gap
Backpack backpack backpack, rap whenever was that

"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will
Be loving you 'til we're 70

And, baby, my heart
Could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul
Could never grow old, it's evergreen

And, baby, your smile's
Forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh, baby, we found love right where we are

And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well

A-a-a-a-a-a-a, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human
Only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh good God, let me give you my life

"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know

And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And is the only thing
That I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die, mmm

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart

'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me

I'm still fighting for peace

I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' f- sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face, spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over, but you promised her
Next time, you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm p-, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
""Next time? There won't be no next time""
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to f- leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

And be hopeless

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry

Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high-fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York (ayy, aha) (uh, yeah)

There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (aha, aha, aha) (uh, yeah)

New York (yeah), New York (uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add

Eight million stories out there in the naked

Let's hear it for New York (uh)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

In New York (ayy, ow) (uh, yeah)

One hand in the air for the big city (oh)
Streetlights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (oh)
No place in the world that could compare (nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah"" (come on, come on)

"I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-
Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho-ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes
(What you see? What you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shining lights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Ben's completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up, Oprah?)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see? What you see bruh?)
I see my name in shining lights (uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)

"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth
He's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack
Blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer
But they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Llike my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone

"Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in

I'm burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap

Been there, done that messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now, I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead

Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid

Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby, your time is running out

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said
""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Take a little trip down my lane, my girl
While you're out every night I will feel alright

How many years say ya want come kiss this
Girl, 'cause ya miss this

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old

And nobody's ever done it like I did it

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away

They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on

You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

Uh, used to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love
But you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care, but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we're both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club
I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, whatchu trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think its better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her
You made me wanna
Say bye bye
Say bye bye
Say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick
She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work

"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

I shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness

But understand nothin' was done for me

Hey, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me

Old money Benjamin Button, what? Nothin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me
When they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasn't

You're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and godamn he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I would never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

I shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it

This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it

Payback motherfucker for the way that you doubted me
How's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me

But there's so much time

To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone

And I'm thinking two is better than one

You make it hard for breathing

'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay

"This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We could've worked it out
Uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there, but

I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something baby, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby, oh-whoa

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

I can't help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah

Is it my mistake that where I am ain't where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live
Is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair
And now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you

Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50-50
But now I'm at the 40-40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole

I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine

Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favourite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothin' but a memory
From the house that built me

Momma cut out pictures of houses for years
From better homes and garden magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to momma's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothin' but a memory

You leave home, you move on
And you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world
And forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself

If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave

"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh (oh-oh)

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need them, oh

Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls

"When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

But you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow

And then I gotta shudder any little thing that nigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again

And niggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this

And I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go
See the way we on and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
We struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And always gotta take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it

If you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak

Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil

What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' fuck 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight

Yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh

See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember, you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember, you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember, you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes (hard)

Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexified
So let's go-o-o (let's go)

We're tearin' it apart-part-pa-pa-pa-part

If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song

So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think, that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be, a little hazy
But you just cannot deny

There's a spark, in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?

Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

"Sweet love yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself

I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on
The phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
Pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please

You go out to eat, he can't pay y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors, next week it's the fries

Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on
Watch me and Imma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at ya wan break my back

An' wit the wagon hit chu in the back of the Magum
For the record

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore

Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again

But words are only words, can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel more than ever, baby

But I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
And I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

What if I could hold you 'til I feel you move inside of me?
And what if it was paradise? And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

"Yeah, let's take 'em back, uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope for a four finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em
Kill a nigga on my song and really do it
That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride and if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted, I think
What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn't understand!

But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself!

I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

Wishing to be the friction in your jeans

Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?

"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Y'all, This one here goes out to all my playas out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she couldn't take it no more and decided to leave

Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin for her
I was feelin so I had to take a little ride
Backtracking on these few years
Tryin'a figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Then the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely

(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
Stop playing girl and come on home
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished to ever hurt my baby
And its drivin' me crazy cuz I'm so...

Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beatin' and tearin' down your walls

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eying you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could

But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on, on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, 'cause tonight we cutting, gut busting

I'm digging in your walls something vicious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut something serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses

And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I'll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom

What it is hoe, ah what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beatin' and tearin' down your walls

Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you 'til you run out of breathe
Then bust a nut all over yourself

The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall

I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

From the back then to the side to the front
Turn around, you down to ride
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey and that's fo' sho'

What it is hoe, ah what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beatin' and tearin' down your walls

What's the business baby, can I get in them drawers
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
'Cause you the one, a nigga met at South Dekalb Mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all

135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, you a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you

So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'ma tell you like this, 'cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
'Cause all I wanna do is just drill
With that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill

And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

What it is hoe, ah what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls

But I won't stop till I'm pullin' out tracks, tracks

But she wanted a man with a little security
Said, I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sicily
Said she wanted it all night

So delicious and so damn edible

With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves

And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'Cause I'm 'bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs

One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but

Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed

The king back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin', money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin' shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt Town

I got the crowd yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Yeah, what other rap nigga hooder than this?
I got rich and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rappin' 'bout blow, I was movin' the shit
You talkin' 'bout shootin out, and I was doin' the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon' be suin' and shit
And if I catch another case, I know I'll truly be missed

So I'ma keep it cool, head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows, other rappers is bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

I got a packed house yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back they yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Mic check 1-2, 1-2, you wanna beef with the king? What is you gon' do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend'll play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'll be hittin' the deck
I got a tool and a vest, I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Sho' 'em, this ain't the squad for a nigga to test

Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with Nines, AK's and TECs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef? Nigga, bring ya best 'cause we'll be standin'-

In ya front yard yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-OHHH (I don't want to fight it)

Yo, you was the last dude, I thought I'd be attached to
Caught me off guard, started feelin' on my tattoo
Blow my back, then you would spit in my ear
I don't want to scare you, but I think that we should disappear
Homey, we ain't known each other very long
Now you trying to lock me in the room, trying to turn me on
Any other time, I could resist, now my will is gone
Getting weak, that ain't E-V-E, hell, is going on

Oh, been tryin' to let it go
Tryin' to keep my eyes closed
Tryin' to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak

Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh, wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinkin' just too much
I wanna set it off but

You did this 1 thing and I was so with it

Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep pickin' up my cell?
Memories just keep ringin' bells

My high heels are clickin' towards your door

And maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did
I can't deny, tired of tryin'
Open up the door but I keep on seein' you
I'm hopin' you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me, did what you did, yeah

Slipped up, let you in my space, got a chick stuck
Close my eyes, see your face, that's a bit much
I ain't the type to get strung all out
Now when I sit and dial your number, got my tongue all out
Wouldn't never tell you though, emotions I would never show
Gotta keep it to myself, gotta keep it low
You got me trippin', who you thought it would be?
Keep it knockin' with E-V-E and Amerie
C'mon (Oh-Oh, don't know what it is...)

"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holding you

Were you born to resist or be abused?

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use

I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose

My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best

Oh, ho-oh

The hope that starts the broken hearts
Your trust, you must confess

The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby

From the moment that I met you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me, and you want me, and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you, I'll put it down be the woman for you

If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way

"I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake, a smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

"Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past

Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody else
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is) when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad

Then he said goodbye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
(Truth is) when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
Because I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing
With my mind, because I know

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) but it's killing me 'cause, now I know

And it's such a miracle that
You and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through

I know we're cool
I know we're cool

We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through

I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been

I know we're cool
I know we're cool
C-cool, uh uh
I know we're cool, uh uh

Yeah, I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah
I know we're cool, yeah
Me and you.

Heads up (woop, woop)
Here's another one
And a, and another one

Yeek, yeek (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Yeek, yeek (woop, woop) I ain't playin' around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

(Woo!)
S-s-so come on, come on
Don't get swung on, swung on
It's the knick-knack paddywhack, still ridin' Cadillacs
Family off the street made my homies put the baggies back
Still stackin' plaques (yep)
Still action packed (yep)
And dough, I keep it flippin' like acrobats
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
'Cause on my waist there's more heat than the Shaq attack

But I ain't speakin' about ballin', ballin'
Just thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start bawlin'
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changin' the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
'Cause I'll prove it, scratch off the music
Like, ""Hey, little stupid, don't make me lose it""

Yeek, yeek (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear

I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)

See I caught him with a right hook
Caught him with a jab
Caught him with an uppercut
Kicked him in his ass
Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk
Ain't no trips to the county, I ain't for that walk

We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your fame
Put a DTP pendant at the end of ya chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

Yeek, yeek (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?

Hey! You want what with me?
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck with me!
(Get down) 'cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm havin' a bad day
Don't make me take it out on you

You want what with me?
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck with me
(Get down) 'cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm havin' a bad day
Don't make me take it out on you

Man, 'cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the mornin' with a story to tell
I know it's been a lil' while since I been out the house
But now I'm here you wanna stand around runnin' your mouth
I can't hear nothin' you sayin' or spittin', so what's up?
Don't you see we in the club, man, shut the fuck up

Yeek, yeek (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that

So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon' have to show me
You gon' make me bring this chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin', wonder when it's gon' cease
Choppa hit you in the side and create a slow leak

We can end the speculation 'cause today we gon' see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the fed's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows, and they waitin' on me

If I was slangin' dope, you couldn't get an OZ
See me at the PSC, follow through and the show deep
Hommies holdin' up the dough 'cause they know we tote heat
I just wanna wrap a C, blow a dro' in a flee
Only playin' 'bout a dozen different bitches in a week

I just wanna chill with country and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin' out everytime, every stone is but a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas courtsey at KT
Fact, I only got a mill' as well as a dolla DP
Ak house on the hill right next to JD
Everyweek be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets

"These words are my own (ah yeah, ah)
Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you

I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily (woah-oh)

Trying to find the magic (woah- oh)
Trying to write a classic (woah-oh)
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Woah oh)
Waste-bin full of paper (woah-oh)
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a Hip-Hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines

You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

There's no other way (there's no other way)
To better say

The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic

"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without the warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the god and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

I said I been here a time or two
She said ""Hello my name is Bobby Jo,
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""

As I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand""
I said ""Dave...""

I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says ""Oh yes, you can""

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff

May not be good as I once was, but I'm as good once

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

Maybe we'll crash and burn

Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight

But maybe we'll grow

"She's cold and she's cruel but she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams but I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, she's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret for more than an hour
She runs on one hundred proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do? I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

The way she sees it's me on her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone, she'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word that she's ever said
Still ringin' in my head
Still ringin' in my head

She's cold and she's cruel but she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say so my whole day is ruined

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony, in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh-oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do, do, do, do you
But do you, do you, do, do
But do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short

Some shit still look back get sad

Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more

Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there talk shit all night

","Dead and Gone (feat. Justin Timberlake)","T.I."
"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking His last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I want to be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

Early morning
The city breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?

"I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me

"Not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me
Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky
Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could
Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em
Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down, yeah

This a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty

Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life (eh-eh-eh)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (eh-eh-eh)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh, eh-eh-eh)

Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh)
Just livin' my life (ayy) my life (oh)
My life (ayy) my life (oh) just livin' my life

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

"There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kind of girl
Don't like the back seat, gotta be first (oh-oh)
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break

"Collie Buddz*
I smoke the best weed
I carefully pick out the stems and seeds (seeds)
The doctors orthers keeps my eyes a bleed
And ever night a different gal a breed (breed)
I never smoke alone
So mr weed man please pick up your phone (phone)
I need some herb to get inna the zone
And my girl kasandra needs a quarter pound (pound)
A just the video light bless up the woman keep them sitting tight (tight)
If you wah come back to my place I'll fuck you right
Anytime you want the ride girl just call me day or night (night)
It's just the medicine little bit of weed mix with the good liquor trigers my adrenaline
Little bit of weed never kill no one mr law so don't be mad at me, me, me
Legel or not that shit don't matter me, me, me

Day and night
I find myself thanking god for my left
Because I took all the wrong and made it right
And I picked rapping over dealing white, white, white
I took my fathers hustle, And I took all of my families struggle

Mixed it up with all my mothers pain, But wot you see is wot gives pitbull's a name, name, name

Because day and night
I find myself alone in this fame

They know my music but not my mind
They can try but they won't stop my hustle grind, grind, grind

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind,
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play
Now look at this

Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last last

Because day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

We born to die
So I get high just like I'm born to fly
I'm in the court wif marijuana eyes
We hit the clubs until the morning rise
Cause day and night
We run the streets
Hope I dnt pay dat prise
Dey qot d nerve to tell me press my brakes
And If I do how will rent qet paid paid
So now I'm thinkin dat
2OO stacks wat wuld it bring me back
Espically now dat reseccions hit

My only answer to my question is is
Okay now here is a thought
Streets is a marriage that u can divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love

So I treat the game just like I'm selling drugs, drugs

Because day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

(Trick trigga uh songz aye)
Tell me what's happening
I'm addicted to plastering
These rappers beats with my vocals
What happens when I'm ask 2 sing
No problem on instrumentals
I guess they ask 4 me
Then I answer give em cancer
And they come back for me
So why they mad at me
Cause my mental compacity
Get to over lapping them bastards
The audasity haters even clap 4 me
Realizing actually I represent the betterment
And they just late like letterman, man
Trey Song Page Long
List of who I'm better than
Contact my d a zon
I might need excederin
Sicker than I eva been
They won't me instead of em
And if they dislike it
I'm letting them so let em in (Come on)
Guess I'm spose to let em win
If u was to bet again
It be best if you would just
Put paper on the medicine
I'll let u know
I walk all thrrough ya vestibule
I guess u know I'll stretch ya hole
Her love drip on my testicals
T.M.I. but he is I
And I am him flying then
Perpellers u so jealous
You can tell us jus e mail us
I'm a problem no use in hatan
There ain't no calculating
I'm so nasty on the beat
Jus like a freak that's masterbatin
Be makin fashin statements
When I leave my place of residence
Feel like I'm intelligent
And everybody is hella dence
Irrelavent and the only exception is
My relevance u lookin at the future
If ever I'm in ya presence shit
Hated right trey be like
Haters get ya paper right
Swear u fly tellin lies
Couldn't live a faker life
They love it shout out
To kid cudi I like the little lovely
And ya city something pretty
Y da kids call u ugly
Man I'm buggin I be tripping
I be playing but they listening

I'm saying what the bidness
What u missing I'm the illest
I do this n my free time
Man u can search
But you will never
Find a week line

"I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Yeah!

Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda
And Tamara
Ménagez-moi
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Baby like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin'
I'm somethin'
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, Like the remainder

I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No not this time

Woah, ohh
Woah, ohh
Woah, hmm

She's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Hmm, nobody's talking
'Cause talking just turns into screaming, oh

And now is I'm yelling over her
She yelling over me
All that that means
Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse?)
That we don't even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing
Fighting for nothing
Crying for nothing, woah
But we won't let it go for nothing
No not for nothing
This should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now?

Girl, when you're constantly accusing
(Asking questions like you already know)
We're fighting this war
Baby, when both of us are losing
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)

(What happened to working it out?)
We fall into this place
Where you ain't backing down
And I ain't backing down
So, what the hell do we do now?

It's all for nothing
Fighting for nothing
Crying for nothing, woah
And we won't let it go for nothing
No not for nothing

(Feat. Drake)

Since BIG ain't here, I'mma do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave for Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, gettin' beat on by their man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missin' women out there, let's just focus on them

This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm about to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way
When police came our way, my daddy had his act on
Like it never happened: (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga, she ain't gotta deal wit' ya
You want some money? Nigga I ain't get a deal wit' ya
You ain't sayin' nothin', you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air cause
You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve McNair

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I, wont)
If you don't, you gon' really love us (I said I wont)
Please don't use us, dooon't

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models, but hmm... I don't believe 'em
Who's still gettin' tested?
Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be your King, be a Queen Latifah
I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa
I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of
You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly
A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly
Her hearts a lil' chilly, she a little too carefree
In 10 years, who's paying for all that therapy
Umm, nigga not me!
Yeah, I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I'm done with bad bitches I'm coming straight to you
Good girl

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon' really love us
Please don't use us, dooon't

Drizzy, I'm sittin here watchin' Basketball Wives
Like ugh, them is basketball wives?
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first day
Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday
And tell her ass, get on
That type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy world""
""Get busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girl""
She walking round the club all lost like ""where is he, girl?""
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray
That's your girl, nigga go on make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche, like ""Lets ride""

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon' really love us
Please don't use us, dooon't

Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And that's my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don't ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went

Yeah I'm married to the game

"I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know, never-never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No! No! No! N-No!""
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you

I'm not loving you way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell ya 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See, I had to go, see, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keeping your love locked down
Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose

I'm not loving you way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keeping your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down

"Oh, ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre)
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

And we're starting this party from dusk

(And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!)
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm

Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'

Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move"", a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes

I'd roll outta bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home, to come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
The shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Now I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

There was nowhere to hide

"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said, ""Each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride""

(What if, what if), if today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late?
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
(Would you, would you) would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(Would you, would you) if today was your last day?

(What if, what if) if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try (try, try)
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

(What if, what if), if today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late?
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
(Would you, would you) would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?

(Would you, would you) and would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
(Would you, would you), and would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love (finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way (way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?

"Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue (taste it on my tongue)

The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh-so-bad it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever but now it's over

Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinning 'round a rollercoaster ride
The world stuck in black and white

You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush

I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever but now it's over

All the time I wasted on you
All the bullshit you put me through
I'm checking into rehab 'cause everything
That we had didn't mean a thing to you

I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever but now I'm sober

I used to be love drunk but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye

And I just laughed and said y'all get in

She was looking too good not to go somewhere

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand

And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass

When you burned down the house and home?

"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried

And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

"Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh, yes they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat as I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now, so love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger

"This old man and me
We're at the bar and we
We're havin' us some beers and
Swappin' ""I don't cares""
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the Hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

He said I fought two wars
Been married and divorced
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, ""These damn things will kill me yet""

But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call it's 2:00 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as Hell
Huh, but me, I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

"She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She's got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin why it is
Tell 'em I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say

Them birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible, professional
Drinkin' X and O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I-, whoa

Did her thing, I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bankroll

Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans filled with guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make your moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon, three stacks c'mon
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playin'? Baby-girl, I'm the man
I invented rubber bands

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh, me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry, but I had to fold her

Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin', and make me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them Rosay bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap

"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love

Oh, you cut me open and I

But you gettin carried away
Sayin we can do it where-ever
The way you touchin me I know what a rying your hardest to make me give in
But I'mma be down to give you what'chu want if you keep it uuupp
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rollin up on us
I'm not hesitatin, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted
But'chu decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let'chu get in

I said we could do it like a stack
I mean we could do it like a g
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty we could get it on
I'm like, shout-out to the DJ for playin this song
Girl we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doin a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl

And it started with a hug
But now we makin love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watchin us
But we don't give a damn what they say

Not my intention

Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Under covers, staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

That you make me smile, please stay for a while now

'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows

I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home, if one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place, or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again, play it again

Oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all you're sounds

And baby the way you make
My world go round
And I just wanted to say
I'm sorry

I think I'm to blame

The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing

I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

"Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's slowly pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back
'Cause all this time I've just been to blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live is not what we have
It's what we believe

And it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go
I won't go

"It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
""Who's there?"" No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realise that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly, I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, oh, yeah
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV (no)
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything
Quickly, I'm learning, ooh, to love again
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, oh, yeah
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be (no-no-no, no-no-no)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, oh, oh, oh
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, yes, I do
It'll all get better in time

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, yes

And ain't nobody takin' from us and that's the bottom line

You don't know how not to lay low

"Somewhere, there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island, into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

I am everything you want, I am everything you need

Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first!

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Do not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

(Chorus)
What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl, didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cos he will never change

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me

Then I start back at one

So incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart

I see the coming of the sun

Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line

"This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her, when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making the promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her, when she smiles

How many lovers would stay?
Just to put up with this shit day after day
How do we wind up this way?
Watching the mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the soles I would choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of the shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her, when she smiles

Well your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her-

This is the story of a girl
Who's pretty face she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her-

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her, when she smiles
When she smiles

You are the antibody

And the end is near
So push rewind, just in time

It's just the way that you talk
Like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes

Take your knocks, shake 'em off
Duck everybody
You're gonna take 'em again

You are the paparazzi
You are the tragedian

And the world's a craze

And when it comes, it moves so slow
Kind of like it's saying, ""I told you so""
Looking back before she goes
Tomorrow's gonna hurt

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied
To a horse that will never tire
And in the flames her shadows play
In the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever
Tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves
In the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love

Aman aman aman

I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain

No sweet perfume ever
Tortured me more than this

This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall

We doin' big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin' big pimpin' up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

Nigga it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black bar-rio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe
Then sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck a scary hoe
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin' they say, ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit

We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo vocab
Don't be surprised if yo hoe stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo slab
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I then you wait while I get yo bitch butt-naked, just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track

Timbaland let me spit my pro's on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool

We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
'Cause we be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
And we be big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
'Cause we be big pimpin' in P.A.T.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B nigga

Uh, smokin' out, throwin up, keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all
If I wasn't rappin' baby, I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chromin' shinin' sippin' daily, no rest until whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Comin' down in candied toys, smokin' weed and talkin' noise

We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
'Cause we be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
And we be big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
'Cause we be big pimpin' in P.A.T.

"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all

Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me

She chose to stay at home
So they could be a family
For the children but what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
And she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22, either way it hurts
Someone that you lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

And I, and I
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

I wish, I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside

And when the path gets rough
We can give into brighter nights, breathe with peace
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
The passion's deep, and filled with heat

Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holla if ya hear me 'cause Left Eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified

Surely, I done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got
But love is furious 'cause I believe in blowing up spots

I'm digging you and I'm feeling you
And you know what's up (Untouchable, Eddie F)
Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wanting you (Darren Lighty, Left Eye)

Still I feel the same

They say it way out loud

"Y'all know me still the same ol' G
But I been low key, hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's, mad at me

'Cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies

But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies

Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, â€½Motherfuck the policeâ€
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good

Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop

Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all all of y'all, if y'all don't like me blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they
Got something to say but nothin' comes out
When they move they lips, just a buncha gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
(What)
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study your tape of NWA

One day I was walkin' by with a Walkman on
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
(What you lookin' at?)
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck, right next
To a humongous truck in a two car garage

Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through

Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
(Right there)

From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew

Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies in a Mercedes Benz
With the windows up and the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy, there is no way
That you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailey
(Da, da)

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they
Got something to say but nothin' comes out

If it was up to me, you muthafuckas would stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me

But now that I gots new company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of
(Compton)

I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all

'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail
All day sayin' Dre fell off, what 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad, tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath

It ain't gonna be nothin' after that, so give me one more
Platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle
In this habitat but all you savage cats knew that I was strapped
With gats when you were cuddled with cabbage patch

On the merry-go-round that we call life.
Take a drive on cruise control,
Then you wait to find it's a winding road.
I had my dreams in view,
When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky.

And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down.

One fine day you wake up,
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love.
He's just what you're lookin' for,
The only problem is, that the man's not sure.
Another guy'll give you everything,
The only problem is you don't feel a thing.
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.
Oh, one day you get what you want.
But it's not what you think.
Then you get what you need.

"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail
Waiting there for me

I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face
With my own destiny?

Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, ""Can I see you again?""

She said, ""Yes!"" And I said, ""Wow!""
She said, ""When?"" And I said, ""How about right now?""
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate, and she said, ""Yes!""

But days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me
The man I wanna be

She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious
She was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said, ""Yes!"" And I said, ""Wow!""
And she said, ""When?"" And I said, ""How about right now?""
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate, and she said, ""Yes!""

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since

"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we'll have
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
We worked nights on end 'till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now it's me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned

Sayin' I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she'll give me some time

But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years

But I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone

In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?

And what matters to me the most

But in time your heart will heal

Have to find what life is like without you

And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now
We could hang around this town forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance
What about now, how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round

Wondering where you are

I wished, wished for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine?

She's from the city of angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes

Shake her hand around nine pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh

My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV

Wanna take her picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down

I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh

I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars

I said, cowboy, take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can, into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to Heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile

I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I wanna stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh

"Every morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand how to work it out
Once again, as predicted
Left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

"How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here

My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind (my mind) (my mind)

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken, oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, ""Love wins again""

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here (nobody's supposed to be here)

This time I swear I'm through but if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I've cry, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

And everywhere you turn

And the storm keeps on twisting

Escaping one last time

There's a log on the fire, and it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire, to take me away (oh, it's true)
It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darlin', please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
But girl, you know I got to go, oh
And Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

"Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream, that I heard last

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
And now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

"I was always okay
But I watched friends grow up poor
Not sure where their next meal would be
Latchkey and and lonely at heart

Every single breath I take is reassurance
I try not to take my life for granted
It all just flashes by so fast
Try to savour our time before it's gone

What I wouldn't give to be standing next to you
A lifetime of struggle just to get where I am
Persistence, resilience, and a heart full of flair
I've made this far and I'm not stopping here

All these old songs take me back
Summer nights with my best friends
Walking through a town that never
Cut us any slack

I've always had this scary feeling
That everything good in my life
Will be gone by the time I wake up
I've had it too good for too long

What I wouldn't give to be standing next to you
A lifetime of struggle just to get where I am
Persistence, resilience, and a heart full of flair
I've made this far and I'm not stopping here

The things I thought I needed
Were just holding me back
I'm doing fine without you
I'm growing without your chains
I never thought I'd live
To see the day where
I'd finally get to
Be on my own

"Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinking
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
That burns like hell when two soles meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke

"Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day, you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast

Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

But I know that I still need you here

"When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When Mama said that it was okay

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'll be singing on TV

The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay

Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay

'Cause we were good kids

I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I always keep 'em tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

You ever loved somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' f- sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face, spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over, but you promised her
Next time, you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm p-, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
""Next time? There won't be no next time""
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to f- leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm a crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me ""nothing lasts,"" like I don't know
You could kiss my-, asking about my motto

You should enter in festivals, or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
It's pretty cool, right?

"It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around

Please turn those headlights around

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit

But, you're takin' me

One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)

Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from the country caters
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases

Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a Hummer

Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beef in there, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (yeah)
Every time we meet, naive

When I stare in your eyes

To watch our life (to watch out life together)
You just like going to Heav- (my heart)

It's mad how I get so high
It's mad how you get me by (by)

Look in my eyes, tell me a tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide

I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (hah)
Yeah, yeah

That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it from miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild

Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do it for streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights, got 52 weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me beat and I turn to a beast

Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat

So He must be hearing shit
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, so you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
Connected to a higher power
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods

No taste buds, hoe later
Fuck you looking at, hater?

Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"", pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate

So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in

Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you declining, now that's kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags

We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask

Diamonds in the dark in your old bedroom
You held me like my mother made me just for you
You held me so close that I broke in two

It tears through my head, does it haunt you too?
Never really said that I loved you too
Lucky, lucky you 'cause I'm fortune's fool

And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybe you're out to find love, maybе you lost who you was
Maybe you're just like mе and feel the need to stay in your rut
'Cause if you left it, you might feel like that you're no longer you
It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
But still relate and feel the same, so in a way, guess we do

You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
If the door was open, would you take flight
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
Take a walk with me, take a risk with me
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
When you're so empty to disown everything
You hold dearly when you know clearly

You been so buried in your own fairytale

Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (infested)

Let it take over your body, it makes ya
Question the life that you have
Situations you might have endured become nothin' but dated
Old and forgotten, but what would you say if
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
I know what you're thinkin', I'm thinkin' it too
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?

See, I could pretend like I have all the answers
But none of us do, it's the reason we battle
Convincin' yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
To every part of you, but what if we did
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk

Ridin' 'round in that Lamb' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm bitin' out that Richard Mille

I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired

That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit

Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping

My people them steady trapping, and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash, and then he post the crib (nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news

If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people

I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough

Ain't no limitations to things we do
We just kickin', and now she'll be lovin' me soon
I be straight to the point, ain't no cut on a movie
Fuckin' her good all over the room
Make her nut, she'll lay there, she don't even move
I gotta go, but I'm coming back soon

Don't tell our business, you know that's the rules
It feel good to tell someone to Google you
I tell 'em, ""Chill,"" 'cause I know what they'll do to you
I run Atlanta, get paid like I'm Julio
We made a way from the streets to the studio
Anyone feelin' me, that's who I do it for
You can't just pop out and say you the hero
You gotta put on a cape and save the day

Shawty my type, she ain't got no stomach
Look her dead in the face when I'm cummin'
Send a video, and tell me she want it
Just the other day, I gave her some money
Plead the fifth, I ain't making no comment
If it happened to them niggas, we done it
Too much shit to step for, I can't be runnin'
Boy, don't make me fly your bitch out the country

She tryna fuck me when I'm fasting, she can't come around no more

I just hope that you learn how to deal with me
I only be out with a couple of niggas
Now shit bound to happen whenever we deep
I run with some hitters, they run from a camera
And they won't even take a picture with me

The teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up
I stood up and told her, ""Big Meech""
My mama ain't have much and I wasn't good at no sports
So you know, I had fell to the streets
And I ain't no Chef Boyardee
But I get me a lil' bit of food, I'ma make sure we eat
And that shit be crazy how we used to swap our spit with each other
We don't even speak

Come with me, we'll be gone for months
My lil' shorty, show her how to roll blunts
Hit Rodeo, let her get what she like
Drop a bag on her, she get excited
Tryna steal her heart, I'm on a heist
I only trust her, long as she in my sight
One thing she know, we in this shit for life

She tryna fuck me when I'm fasting, she can't come around no more

But magically I got the strategy
I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me, ""Who was the killers between the hood?""
Bro I'm a king, that mean we good (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

Talked to my TT about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my choppa
Before I was 12, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Follow with loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies
Don't mention my name if you mention them bodies

""Stop taking drugs after sending a song""
How you gon' blame me? Y'all give him cabaña

Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my parker, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, have speed, no tossin'

Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal

I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (oh no, oh)

I love the bitches who say they ain't hurtin' me
Never seen blood, that shit'll turn burgundy

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dog since a toddler
16 years old when I shed my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa Locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (fly helicopters)
I count every blessin' and count every dollar

I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dogs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase

That my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only rumors throughout my circle
Only rumors throughout my circle, oh

600 Maybach, the one with the curtain

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go

I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me
What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?
It's only me
Let it go

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles

At least we can swim far away from the wreck we made

You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal

Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean who would wanna hide this?
I will never ever ever ever ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friends, ""Shoot your shot""
When you see 'em
It's OK, he already in my DMs

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

I got big stacks comin' out the safe

I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face

Roll with us if you really wanna get it
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter

'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist

Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it

When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign, must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got

But my heart's been hurt a couple times by a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
Cause I'm tired of the fake love, show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

Oh, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?

So c'mon ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So c'mon ride with me, ride with me

Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent

And I'm like, ""Whoa
Man, my neck so goddamn cold""
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh, oh-oh
My money thick, won't ever fold

It's 50 on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch

Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop

We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright

Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans, though
All VVS, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they're matching with the jewelry

Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes
Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals""
Bitch, I'm who they tryna be

Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front

I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills
I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me
Their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped
You a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way
You can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts
Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip
I bet you dip, he dip, she dip

I say I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe

I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm strutting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show you can tell it I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled valet open doors
Wiz like go away got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go
And take that little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

Now I'm at a payphone

"I had a way then, losing it all on my own
I had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (home)
You shine it when I'm alone (home)

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place, the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

They told you I was moving on, over you

I'd come back swinging

Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you, I'm finally thinking about me

"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When laying with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes, feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touch your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died

"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
You should go and love yourself

Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once, I was 20 years old

Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world, and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old

Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

I wanna benefit from the friendship

"I guess for now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party

I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollerin', I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh, I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message
(Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh, I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done

I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low

Yo, I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh, I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away

And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
And tell me your life's been way offline
You're falling to pieces every time

And I don't need no carryin' on

'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, ""Don't lie""
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

And I don't need no carryin' on

And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back, and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

To see if you can work me the way you say

Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

"You know this song means a lot to me
There was a time in my life
Where I couldn't love myself enough
To love anybody
But now I'm in love
And for Mary J Blige that's real
You know relationships are really hard to keep together
But let me explain to y'all what happened

Chemistry was crazy, from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom

They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real (yes)
See baby we been

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get
Home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)

Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get
Home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day everyday)
Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart

And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she's the one
(Fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love

Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby

Remember, you said I was the one
For you
Remember I believed in what
You said was true
Remember, remember
I'm telling you, telling you, oh, oh

Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
Stay, stay, stay, stay
I can't be without you

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crises
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

It's me
Hi!
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism?
Like some kind of congressman
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

It's me
Hi!
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell!""

I'm the problem, it's me

Maybe together we can get somewhere

Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally, see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him""

Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in a market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids

Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

I'm the voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still undeployed

I know a felon who tryna get FOID

For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck

Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO and how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one

I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now, some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself, this shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance
All pistons firin'

I be stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of Lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered Lil' buddy
Now, I'm on the phone, searchin' Lil' buddy name
Got 'em playin' his tunes, all day in my room

Thinkin', ""Damn, this shit is wicked
To get they name buzzin' some niggas
Just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle

On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview
Most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho' phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise

Gotta laugh at the stupidity

But you make the worst one look fine

You only come out at night

But you made me look so naive

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too

Fallin' for each other, pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover, missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?"" Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)

We were just two lovers, feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer, radio on blast, make the moment last
She got solar power, minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine

Fallin' like I did for the love of my life?
She's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes

All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was 12 or somethin'
I ordered two more wines, 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress, and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels, six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi, sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night

Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me, take this pain away
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not 24 hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty

Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm finding it crippling
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzling
If I take a step back to see the glass half full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels, six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi, sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page

Be at peace with the things you can't change (last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah

Toast up, so what? Street small, but it go both ways
So you'll run, yeah, but you'll never escape

"I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm

There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death, so I said
""Climb in,"" and then she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happened to her

I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through enough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And I asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
When he said to me

""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reaching for

I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

Just wait in the truck""

Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me (hey), Lord

It's been 60 months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price, to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night

And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to, yeah

That I won't ever go again
Wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab
And chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like

We were listenin' to one more silver dollar
Hangin' out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride

Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

I don't care how much they're bitin'
I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l'd ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

I even took you to my hometown to meet my Mama
Now, I'm gonna see you every time
I see that welcome sign

Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

I don't wanna hear one more silver dollar

I can't go nowhere near the whiskey

In the bed of my truck
And now, I can't get drunk

But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault

Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and the transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'd die a drunk, I'll die for you

I'll die

Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head and I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic

Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on a cold window, try to sober back up
And loosen my cuffs

And it's all the same anyway

Mm, I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

Well, I'd die for you

I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Oh, son, are you a danger to yourself?""

Fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol (ooh)
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back (ooh)
""Son, why do you do this to yourself?""

And I said, ""I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown,"" ah
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio, ah

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang

You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

Thinking 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings, lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes

I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual
Telling you you're beautiful

Diving underneath

Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (facts)

"Sometimes when I sit back and really let it register
I did everything I said I would, and said it first
I mean the world's in denial, but they all know what I'm headed for
Ah

We 'bout to feed these youngins to the metaverse
Meanwhile, I'm over here just tryna pen a verse
'Cause I'm done bein' extra with the extroverts
The label used to wonder how I'm supposed to stand next to Vert
Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work
I work hard, but hard shit don't need no extra work
That's why I show up in a sweatshirt and let it burn

The world's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, let it turn""
The girl's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, have a turn""
The G.O.A.T.s call me to the side like, ""Can we have a word?""
I could've fronted but I did this shit how I preferred (I preferred)
Mmm, I know I should be humble but it's somethin' I just haven't learned
Soon enough I have to make these bad habits burn
Soon enough we 'bout to come and get the shit we earn

You not a fan now, but I remember when you used to be fanned out
I'm guessin' when the whole world loves you
People only got one way to stand out
All that time in the kitchen finally panned out
I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out
I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hundred grand out
So I'm not gonna pull a hundred grand out

I'm hip-hop, do you fully understand?
Fully automatic with the jams and they don't jam
At the shows I'm 'bout to start handin' out programs
'Cause y'all need to get with the program
I'm a grown ass man, call me pops
Fuck around and take your phone ass man
Everybody know Jack, but they don't know Jack, man
They just know I got the flows and the hoes and the packed out shows

Ain't too many cons when you playin' with the pros
'Cept for how your life get exposed
But I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
I know in Toronto they got soft for the roads
But school's closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed
The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl
School counselors all know how they life is at home
Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home

Before I met Drizzy I knew he and I would get along
But it's hard to crack jokes when you really want advice
I mean what's it like to touch gold every time you touch a mic
Touchin' heights, no one gets a touch in life
Fuckin' right, young bachelor, what's a wife?
Once in a lifetime, 'til I say I want it twice
One of a kind, know your everything is one of mine
Wanted posters with my face, they know who I'm wanted by

Yeah

Yeah

Cold hearts and heated floors, no parental guidance I just see divorce
Therapy sessions, I'm in the waiting room, readin' Forbes
Abandonment issues I'm gettin' treated for
How much water can I fit under the bridge before it overflows?
My son's gotta learn that forgiveness is a lonely road
The cribs on his wheel like motor homes

Niggas love to try and test us like they know what we on
Chubb's got the magazine cover like Rolling Stone
'Cause we already know how they rock, they throwin' stones
Whenever you gettin' bigger, there's growin' pains
I got enough pull to make the city start throwin' games
I'm out here makin' a mockery
I got my realtor out here playin' Monopoly
How can I address you when you don't own property?
They only finesse you when you don't move properly

Destined for the win, but you don't get a prize out of me
I'm destined for the top, but you can't get a rise out of me
750 for the round, canaries, and they glitterin'
Man, you niggas drop trash, you littering
I'm overdelivering to the point, it's belittling
I mean, the PTSD is triggering, the profit is sickening
The stones is shimmering
Came from the north but I got hot as fuck, so ain't no shivering, yeah

Lucky me, people that don't fuck with me
Are linkin' up with people that don't fuck with me to fuck with me
This shit is getting ugly
And every situation is transactional
And every thing they sayin' is irrational
And every way they movin' is promotional
Everybody's actin' irreplaceable, it's like they ain't disposable
My urges for revenge are uncontrollable
I know we're gettin' older though, yeah

But I gotta get a nigga back for that, it's non-negotiable
It's not even debatable
I'm gettin' so rich, my music's not even relatable
I blow her head up, it's an inflatable
Baby blue G class, I feel like a kid again
Prayin' on my downfall don't make you religious, man
All I hear is plug talk comin' from middleman
All I hear is tall tales comin' from little men

When I say ""Bitch"", I'm very rarely referring to women
Most of the bitches I know are niggas, they not even women
I know that sounds like I'm being funny, I'm not even kidding
Same ones that say they run the game when they not even in it
To be honest, y'all financial situations my biggest motivation
And how you should take that statement is based on what you makin'
Whips and chains like a dominatrix, wap, pssh

If I see ya, I spit in ya faces, ha-tu
Daytonas with the green faces
Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive
Box at the Churchill downs, that's motivation, yeah

You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you

You can learn to appreciate me

"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin' so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm, feelin' like ya livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same
Way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway

Maybe, we'll fly the night away

Ma, what you wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show, in the mall, kids ask, ""How'd the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me, I say ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like (yeah)
You have me sleeping in the same bed, e'ry night

Go ride with me, you deserving the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumping N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your brain)
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious, and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?

Maybe, we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby, girl, oh!

Ain't nobody love you, like I love you (can't love you, like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (makes me trust ya like I do) (hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (hey!)
You will know the difference when

Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way

You know, you think about it

Destined to do, what they do

And it's very slowly picking me apart
I've tried to tell myself I have no reason

Now just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thought's your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Ever since, the summer of the 90's

Yeah, they be kickin' it sweet
With them long ol' boots on feet
And check out the way they step
Make your brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they're tan, drive off red
It don't mean what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin' those legs in lily white
So it won't make one difference on you

Come on, baby

Why you wanna pull me over?
'Cause I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song, my profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats
Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today

So I keep away from fools
They do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

I didn't shoot the deputy, I didn't have to
'Cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to the cops to find out who did the murder
They harass the wrong clan and arrest the wrong man
My hommie J dawg got stretched, but that's okay
'Cause I'ma work for life so he can see another day
A homie's a homie, a fake is a snake
Straight game from the pen from the homie Jake

So I keep away from fools
They do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs

"It won't be easy
You think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up

To the nines

At sixes
And sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out

Of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom

Running around
Trying everything new
But nothing
Impressed me
At all
I never
Expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed

To the world
They were all I desire
They are illusions
They're not
The solutions they promise to be

The answer
Was here
All the time
I love you
And hope you love me
Don't cry for me
Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of
To say to you

But, all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word
Is true!

"The boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh, huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know
Do you know somebody named, you, you know his name

Oh, yeah, definitely I know his name
I just wanted to let you know he's mine
Huh, no, no, he's mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

You see I try to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame?

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
Because my love was all it took

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it girl, it's true

I think that you should realize
I'm trying to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you want to say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

But when will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
Special places in my heart?
He was my love from the start

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine

You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it

To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burning like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish

Shootouts for 20 minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacing him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placing them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy

Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screaming, I position, competition
'Nother day in the life of the commission

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at?
Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?

It's all fucked up now
What I'ma do now, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now

"Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of morning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone

And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light - She's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one
And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

But it took a long, long time
And now there's a turnabout
Maybe 'cause I'm tryin'

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say and I can't do

"Turn it up loud

Hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up (I'm a sucka for love)

I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me

But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free, I can't breathe
'Cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love (I'm a sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (I'm a sucka for love)
What you won't do (you won't do), you won't do for love (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)

Just when I thought I broke away, and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost

Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh, what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love (I'm a sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (don't give up, baby) (I'm a sucka for love)
What you won't do, do for love (oh, yeah)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)

Now he left you with scars
Tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own (oh, yeah, yeah)

I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost
Trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it we can do it, now I'm under pressure (yeah)
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love (what you won't do for love) (I'm a sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (girl, you ain't right, you know, I'm a sucka for love)
What you won't do, do for love (you won't do for love, my pretty baby)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no) (I'm a sucka for love)

What you won't do, do for love (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (I'm a sucka for love)
What you won't do (oh, no), do for love (oh no) (I'm a sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love (do)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (every little thing, baby, no, no, no)

She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me ""Heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does

I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
","Drunk In Love (feat. Jay Z)","Beyoncé"
"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain, girl
Caress your frame, get them worries off your brain, girl
I'm in your corner do what you want it's your thing, girl
Oppositess attract, but we one in the same, girl it ain't a game

So I can't play with you, wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you

I can straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be the voice of reason when you ain't tryin' hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it

Sit her on the sofa get a little closer
Touch it right, do it like a man's supposed to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose ya
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten

I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else

Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together and they tried yet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet

Hold you, mold you, drink no liquor, show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

Don't let him sing you a sad song, no baby
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see, I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me

When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected

I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you

Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, 'cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

"Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

Oh-oh-oh
Mmm, yeah

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain

A small but still, resilient voice
Says, help is very near, oh (Oh)

There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now, you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you (When you)
Believe

You will when you (You will when you)
Believe
Just believe (Believe)
Just believe
You will when you
Believe

"Yeah, wish I told her how I felt
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down

I can say it so clearly
But you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had

And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you

I'm tremblin' inside and nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought
You'd hear me

Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get

You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me

Said when the nights are lonely...
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had

And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad

And I just keep thinkin about
The love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me

Nobody knows it, no, nobody but me
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin about

The love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me

Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally, Eazy sees Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him, and I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS, looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for B to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease, ""Well then, please
Bury me by my Gran Gran and when you can, come follow me""

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the lord all 24-7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge, because there's no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what can I do? It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our soul, ayo-ayo

Pray, and we pray and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
Still we lacin'

Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone
They rest, Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creepin' up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'
While you laughin' we're passin', passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

Now Eazy's long gone
Really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dawg?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, oh so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

Somebody really wrong, anybody wanna test us, dawg?

Wanna come again, again and again

"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words

Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got
The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got
Me almost melting away

As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness
A magical time

Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything

Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything

Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always everywhere and everything

Say you'll love and love me forever

"How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga, now tell me how you want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these

Nights full of Alize, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that

They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how you want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin' major

My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried, one of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die

I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

But I'mma mash out and peel out
I'm wit' it quick, I's quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah, nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game, livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real (how you want it)
How do U want it? How do you feel?

No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby, got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound

Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow wow)

East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas

By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, how predictably so

Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be

Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing

"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like ""Freeze!"", we making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say,""Motherfuck that playin'"", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk

Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""

We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something
""Hey, man, you remember me from school?""
""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""

And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues

"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you

Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire, 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you (ooh, I'm over you)
(Over you, yes)

Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby? (Why was I such a fool?) Oh, yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong? (Leaving me all alone)

Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno? (Whoo)
(Tears will cause an inferno, baby)
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame? (Oh)
(Why should, why should I?)
You were the one who left me neglected
(Oh, I'm so sorry, baby)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

I, I gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)
How was I to know, you would weaken so easily?
I, I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out) over you
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain (I never knew)
You, you left me so confused
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)

Don't wanna be a player (TS)

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher still got what you're lookin' for
For my thugs, for my thugs (don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to crush tonight?

Ayo, I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beach, French comtesse, ten thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico

We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick, huh? I'll rip my - through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my - with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I'll knock that boot if you out to get koofed

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher still got what you're lookin' for
Uptown, baby, uptown

But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law

I love 'em Puerto Rican to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat - and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf

It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown - wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
(You nasty, Twin, I don't care)
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks-

Up in the hot tub poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""

"Testin', one, two
Testin', one, two

The house is now on fire
Spread the words, y'all, everybody get somebody, we don't want anybody left with nobody
'Cause you know what time it is
It's time to get busy
And when it's time to get busy
You know what you gotta do
You got to...

Raise the roof because it's all on fire
Not done by the sun or electrical wire
Not done by sons striking matches with daughters
But done by scratches so save that water

This jam is packed so I just figure
All we need is the house to get bigger
So startin' with the roof down to the base
We're at your service to burn the place, come on!

Hey, come on!
Yeah, come on, raise the roof, hey!
Hey
Hey, that's right
Raise the roof
Come on

With the spot as hot as it can get
And the roof's on fire, you're soakin' wet
The puzzle on your face shows as you sweat
But your body keeps movin' with no regrets

Chandeliers shake, swing from front to back
Left to right all night, and the lights don't crack
Your mind's on the time, hopin' it don't end
'Cause it's time to get stupid, here we go again, come on

Hey, come on!
Yeah, yes, come on, raise the roof, hey!
Come on, come on
Raise the roof, y'all

Yes, come on
Stare at the strope, pull your earlobe
For the sights and sounds clear across the globe
This jam might hit or miss the charts
But the style gets wild as state of the art

Dazzling in science, bold in nerve
But givin' my house what it deserves
Served on the floor 'cause I get payed
Make the fans that left wish they had stayed

Realize, my friend, ain't this a trip
As your body gets railed when you do the flip
And your mind gets rocked when we're on a roll
Then the freak of the week makes you lose control

A Swatch for a watch, so you'll know the time
Your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme
The Messiah's on fire and I'm living proof
I'll quench your desire and raise your roof

Hey
Come on, raise the roof
Hey
Come on
Hey
Raise the roof, come on
Come on-come on-come on-come on...
Come on

In school I'm cool throughout the week
When the weekend comes, I'm down with the Greeks
Frat brothers known across the seven seas
Fly ladies of the '80s, sororities

Zetas, Deltas, the AKA's
Women that keep me in a daze
The A-PHI-A Sigma boys on the move
With the Kappas and the Ques and of course the groove

And for real it's the deal and the actual fact
Takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Rejected and accepted as a communist
Claimin' fame to my name as a terrorist

Makin' money in corners that you'll never see
Dodgin' judges and the lawyers and the third degree
Nothin' wrong with a song to make the strong survive
Realize, gave me five 'cause I kept 'em alive

Mislead what you read about my devilish deeds
Misled what I said so you're better off dead
Make 'em hear it and see it for the deaf and blind
And command it and we'll plan it for incapable minds

Take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand
Make the jealous understand it, and just say damn
When they see me ask a question, ""How the hell can it be?""
When they watch me pull a serpent straight from out of the sea

Turn the winter into summer, then from hot to cold
Expand my power on the hour, make you all behold
From the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty Thor
God of thunder, you'll go under, then you'll all applaud

And fathom that distance, the mad must reap
Meet Namor, Sea Lord, Prince of the deep
Here for you to fear at any cost
Tellin' you to get busy or you better get lost

Livin' lives civilized from the lessons I taught
City buried underground just because I went off
My friends, enemies, better be my friend
Is the question people guessin', ""Is this the end?""?

End of the world, are you guessin' yes?
Just say it, don't delay it, get it off your chest
Houses of crack, I've seen too much
I go ready, aim, fire, then I'll blow 'em up
